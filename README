This is a public-domain implementation of a byte-aligned rANS encoder.

rans_byte.h has all the good stuff and comments on how to use it.
rans_word_sse41.h is a world-aligned SIMD decoder (I'll write more about this
later).

See my blog http://fgiesen.wordpress.com/ for some notes on the design.

I intend to write a blog post about the design soon. Until then, sneak preview!

Results on my machine (Sandy Bridge i7-2600K) with 64-bit code:

rANS encode:
12896496 clocks, 16.8 clocks/symbol (192.8MiB/s)
12486912 clocks, 16.2 clocks/symbol (199.2MiB/s)
12511975 clocks, 16.3 clocks/symbol (198.8MiB/s)
12660765 clocks, 16.5 clocks/symbol (196.4MiB/s)
12550285 clocks, 16.3 clocks/symbol (198.2MiB/s)
rANS: 435113 bytes
17023550 clocks, 22.1 clocks/symbol (146.1MiB/s)

16901632 clocks, 22.0 clocks/symbol (147.1MiB/s)
17166188 clocks, 22.3 clocks/symbol (144.9MiB/s)
17235859 clocks, 22.4 clocks/symbol (144.3MiB/s)
decode ok!

interleaved rANS encode:

9488277 clocks, 12.3 clocks/symbol (262.1MiB/s)
9460194 clocks, 12.3 clocks/symbol (262.9MiB/s)
9582025 clocks, 12.5 clocks/symbol (259.5MiB/s)
9332017 clocks, 12.1 clocks/symbol (266.5MiB/s)
interleaved rANS: 435117 bytes
10687601 clocks, 13.9 clocks/symbol (232.7MB/s)
10637918 clocks, 13.8 clocks/symbol (233.8MB/s)
10909652 clocks, 14.2 clocks/symbol (227.9MB/s)
10947637 clocks, 14.2 clocks/symbol (227.2MB/s)
10529464 clocks, 13.7 clocks/symbol (236.2MB/s)
decode ok!

Note that this is running "book1" which is a relatively short test, and
the measurement setup is not great.
